# RobotWars-Opentable-Project

The Robot-Wars Project is Java-based application which is used to deploy robots and find their final position as well as their head direction according to the user intructions. Implemented according to the given problem statement using Java Rich Features to design and develop understable code.

## Features

- Add Robots to the given Arena according to the user input.
- User Defined inputs for initial position and orientation (direction of the head of Robot) and the arena's dimensions (maxX and maxY).
- Instructions to robots, including:
  - Rotate left (L)
  - Rotate right (R)
  - Move forward (M)
- Ensure robots stay within the arena boundaries, preventing out-of-bounds movements.
- Handling exceptions and Written Unit Test cases with good code coverage.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Robot Simulator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/Bhavesh1998/RobotWars-Opentable-Project.git

2. Compile the Java source files:
   javac *.java


3. Run the Main class:
   java Main


4. Follow the on-screen prompts to set up the arena, deploy robots, and issue movement instructions.

## Usage

- When prompted, enter the arena's dimensions (maxX and maxY).
- Deploy robots by providing their initial position (x, y) and orientation (N, W, E, S).
- Provide a series of instructions (L, R, M) to control the robot's movements.
- The simulator will display each robot's final position and orientation after executing the instructions.
